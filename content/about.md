![This is me][1]

My name is Alice and if I have to describe myself in one line I would say that I get bored quickly and I ~~like to~~ question everything (I am a woman, you know).   
Linear career paths are not my cup of tea. I was not born with a specific dream. When I was little I did not want to become a doctor, even though some family members have tried to push me into that, or an astronaut. I have not equally felt particularly gifted for anything. I would say I am more perseverant than gifted.  

That's maybe why I went to a language high school, then I moved from a BA in International Relations, to a Msc in Economics and finally to a PhD in Demography. I have always felt a bit out of place during my formation, but I liked it. It was challenging my *forma mentis*. So, I became "interdisciplinary" by accident, maybe because I have always been more interested in topics rather than in subjects. I usually ask myself *why* rather than *how* and I like to look at different *hows* to try answering the *whys* I become obsessed with. Ah yes, because I am not only perseverant, but also unbelievably stubborn.  

I am  not an expert in anything since I mainly rely on Google in my daily life. However, but a common thread within my education track is my interest Applied Statistics and Data Analysis. I felt that this discipline could allow me the freedom to explore the largest number of topics I want. So I am gently moving towards informatic-statistical languages, so far mainly R.  

At the moment I am finishing my journey in the academic world ~~unemployed in 2 month~~. I will always be grateful to the Swiss Federal Science Foundation to finance my PhD and let me learn so much, but at the moment I feel academia is not the future I am looking for. It is a world a bit detached from reality and with a lot established intellectual narcissism. And even tough I have a ~~relatively~~ big ego, I don not feel that is the right place for me. At least now.  

I love to try food food and wine I have never tried before, running, mountain sports, mornings, tea, breakfasts at home.


#### FAQ I ask myself

How could living and working was possible before Google?  

Was Mark Twain right: "A pessimist is a well-informed optimist"?
