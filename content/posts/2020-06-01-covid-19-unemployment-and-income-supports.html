<p>Data comes from the Current Population Survey, which have been download from: <a href="https://cps.ipums.org/cps/index.shtml" class="uri">https://cps.ipums.org/cps/index.shtml</a> (registration required).</p>
<p>The codebooks for the extraction are the files:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>CPS_19-01_20-04_Extr_Codebook.xml for the core set of questions for monthly samples from 01-2019 to 04-2020.
Among the variables listed in CPS_19-01_20-04_Extr_Codebook.xml, we selected: YEAR, MONTH, CPSIDP, CPSID, COUNTY, STATECENSUS, STATEFIP, REGION, CBSASZ, LABFORCE, OCC, EDUC99, FAMINC, EMPSTAT, UHRSWORKT.</p></li>
<li><p>ASEC_2019_Extr_Codebook.xml for the 2019 Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of 03-2019.
Among the variables listed in CPS_19-01_20-04_Extr_Codebook.xml, we selected: CPSIDP, CPSID, COUNTY, STATECENSUS, STATEFIP, REGION, CBSASZ, OCCLY, UHRSWORKLY, INCTOT, INCWAGE, INCLONGJ, OINCBUS, OINCFARM, OINCWAGE, EITCRED.</p></li>

<p>The Current Population Survey has monthly data for a core set of questions, which include employment status, occupation, geographical information, etc. Extensive data about socio-economic varibales, such as earnings, Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), health insurance, etc. are colleceted once a year (March) by the Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) module.
CPS is a survey which has basically been used for the analysis of cross-sectional data. It has a sampling scheme defined as 4-8-4. One household stays in the sample for max. 16 months (4+8+4). The household is interviewed during each of the first 4 months after entering the survey, followed by 8 without interview. The household is then interviewd again for 4 consequitive month, one year (4+8) after its first wave in order to match the seasonality.</p>
<p>The following figure visualizes the longitudinal structure of the survey. Our data ample cover the time span from January 2019 to April 2020. Each line represent an individual longitudinal record. Wave March 2019 is my master wave since it is the most recent information about EICT and earnigns we have. Gray represents when the individual is out of the CPSâ€™s sample.</p>

<h3>Individual Level Logitudinal Analysis</h3>
<p>At an individual/household level the sample size for individuals and households obseved both in March 2019 (ASEC wave) and April 2020 corresponds to 19,013 individuals and 10,456 households. Among those a sub-sample of 4,700 individuals grouped in 3,984 households are part of the labour force. Visually these are mirrored in the three waves at the top of of Fig. 1. At the end, ~9.3% of the households in the sub-sample have received EITC.</p>

<h3>Aggregate Occupational Level Analysis</h3>
<p>We analaze the CPS data by aggregating over the occupational categories. Our cross-sectional unit becomes the occupational category. The data structure becomes the following</p>
