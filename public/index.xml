      <description>I know, the title sounds intriguing boring and in effect it is. When I started my PhD I did not even know what spatial statistics exactly was. It was my inspiring colleague, Dr.Â Giacomo Benini, who introduced me to that. My PhD is in Demography, more precisely on migration studies. So why should not I apply some spatial statistics to human migration movements? Most of the time I think I have come up with a brilliant idea someone else has already had it.</description>

      <description>My name is Alice and if I have to describe myself in one line I would say that I get bored quickly and I like to question everything (I am a woman, you know).
Linear career paths are not my cup of tea. I was not born with a specific dream. When I was little I did not want to become a doctor, even though some family members have tried to push me into that, or an astronaut.</description>
