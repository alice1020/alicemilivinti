      <description>I know, the title sounds intriguing boring and in effect it is. When I started my PhD I did not even know what spatial statistics exactly was. It was my inspiring colleague, Dr. Giacomo Benini, who introduced me to that. My PhD is in Demography, more precisely on migration studies. So why should not I apply some spatial statistics to human migration movements? Most of the time I think I have come up with a brilliant idea someone else has already had it.</description>
